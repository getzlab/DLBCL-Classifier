step	tool	explanation
1	MuTect1	Call initial mutations
2	Funcotator	initial variant annotation
3	Orientation Bias Filter	filter artifacts originating from FFPE and oxoG sample preparations
4	Panel of Normals	filter out germline mutations
5	BLAT	filter out mutations that have reads that are poorly aligned
6	Oncotator	variant annotation
7	Mutsig2CV	variant significance detection
8	Consensus NMF	perform consensus NMF clustering to establish gold standard
